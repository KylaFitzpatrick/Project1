Project I - Youtify - A battle between Spotify song and Youtube videos.

Description: Our first team project during the UT coding boot camp during spring of 2020.  Teammates included Kyla Fitzpatrick, Jared DePalma, Karina Titov, Justin Wells. The Project idea is to have random users select two Spotify songs and Two youtube videos.  Users can then vote on which song or video they enjoyed more and the battle continues until one of them reaches 15 votes and becomes the new winner!  Users can then start a new battle.  You can also view previous winners to see what people like more. The app is a fun way to discover new songs and videos.

Technologies include: HTML, bootstrap, css, javascript, Youtube API, Spotify API, firebase cloud function, firebase realtime databases.

Challenges: First team project, understanding GIT branches, hiding our API keys in the cloud, getting correct API calls.
